## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing Airbnb listings data for Naples. The goal is to create a clean, structured, and analysis-ready dataset to facilitate insights into listing characteristics, pricing patterns, review trends, and neighborhood-level factors. By preparing and transforming the raw data, this project demonstrates the application of advanced data preprocessing and feature engineering techniques for real-world datasets.

## Project Goals
- Build a complete data preprocessing workflow from raw CSV files to analysis-ready datasets  
- Apply feature engineering techniques to enrich the dataset and improve data quality  
- Perform data aggregation and summary statistics for insightful visualizations  
- Handle missing values, duplicates, and inconsistencies systematically  
- Implement modular and reusable Python scripts for each preprocessing stage  
- Ensure scalability for large datasets while optimizing memory usage  
- Enable downstream analysis for pricing trends, review patterns, and neighborhood insights  

## Dataset Description
The dataset used in this project comes from [Inside Airbnb](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data/) for Naples and consists of the following files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `listings.csv` | Summary information and metrics for Airbnb listings in Naples. Suitable for visualizations and general analysis. |
| `reviews.csv` | Review data linked to listing IDs, enabling time-based analytics and visualization of user reviews. |
